# Capstone: Sephora Reviews 

### Problem Statement

Buying cosmestics is an expensive habit that women all around the world face. A study conducted by Skin Store states that women in New York will spend around $300,000 on skincare and cosmestics products in her lifetime. My wallet has personally felt the impact of how expensive makeup can be, as I have averaged spending over $2,000 on cosmetics alone every year for the last 5 years. 

How can we as consumers save some money on cosmestics? The only option seems to be to either buy cheaper products or wait for something to go on sale. But, how will you know when or even if something will get a markdown? Is there a variable that is a definite indicator of a product going on sale?  

We seek to predict whether or not an item will go on sale using a combination of sentiment analysis on reviews and (theme of features to be determined) using a suite of classification models including Logistic Regression and Multinomial Naive Bayesian Classifiers. The optimal model will be determined on the basis of accuracy. [Link](https://www.skinstore.com/blog/skincare/womens-face-worth-survey-2017/)
